For the past few days, TranscribeIt has been the one on my mind. It has been accepted as a project for mentoring under FOSSIA by [GDG IIIT Kalyani's Winter of Code 5.0](https://winter-of-code-5.devfolio.co/).

So most days go around collaborating with others to encourage them to contribute. The other days go into thinking about architecting the system and optimizing it for efficiency.

So here we go with the lessons learned by building a local multimedia accessibility platform over using proprietary APIs and services.

[Here are the slides, detailing the need, design and architecture, challenges and future improvements](/slides/20251220--building-transcribeit.pdf)
